In my program to give the path of file to be opened to written should be given like this: DictionaryBST *dic = new DictionaryBST("/Users/Usman/Desktop/CS/CS202/hw4/HW4/HW4/test.txt") which is the total path from the root directory. If it is given like this: DictionaryBST dictBST( "dictionary.txt" ), It doesnot work. So please give the whole path for the program to run properly. Thanks.
